# DQN Lunar Lander ‚Äì Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and classical Q-table methods to solve the `LunarLander-v3` environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent is trained using neural networks and a replay buffer, and performance is evaluated via plotted rewards and video recordings of successful landings.

## üöÄ Environment
- `LunarLander-v3` (discrete control)
- Framework: `Gymnasium`  
- DQN implementation with PyTorch

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DQNlunar.py` | Core Deep Q-Learning implementation with training and evaluation loop |
| `lunar.py` | DQN training with video capture of successful landings |
| `newlunar.py` | Evaluates trained model and saves video using `RecordVideo` |
| `record_lunar.py` | Classic Q-learning variant using discrete Q-table + CSV logging |
| `view_q_table.py` | Tool to visualize and export Q-table as CSV |
| `dqn_lunar_lander.pth` | Trained DQN model weights (PyTorch) |
| `successful_landing.mp4` / `training.mp4` | Sample videos of trained agent performance |

## üß† Core Features

- DQN agent with:
  - Experience replay
  - Epsilon-greedy action selection
  - Neural network-based Q-function
- Classic tabular Q-learning with state discretization
- Model saving and loading with `.pth`
- Custom reward shaping for successful landings
- Agent behavior recorded and rendered to `.mp4`
